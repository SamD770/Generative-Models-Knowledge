This code is that used for 
[On Gradients of Deep Generative Models for Representation-Invariant Anomaly Detection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=deYF9kVmIX)

- `generative_model.py` provides interfaces for general use of deep generative models for anomaly detection.
- `models` contains several open source implementations of deep generative models
- `anomaly_methods` contains implementations of deep-generative-model based anomaly detection
- `plots` contains the plotting scripts used in the paper
